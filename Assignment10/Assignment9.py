# Step Difference Number Analyzer

# A mathematics research center studies hidden patterns inside numbers.
# For every entered number, the system compares adjacent digits step by step.

# Write a program to:

# Find the absolute difference between every pair of adjacent digits
# Display all step differences
# Find the sum of all step differences
# Find the largest step difference
# If the sum of step differences is divisible by the number of digits, print Balanced Number
# Otherwise print Unbalanced Number

# Use loops wherever required.

# Input:
# 57294
# Output:
# Step Differences: 2 5 7 5
# Sum = 19
# Largest = 7
# Unbalanced Number
